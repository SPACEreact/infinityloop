# Subtext Notes

## Character Arc Types
- Positive Change: Character might believe in a lie, goes through confrontation, then reaches acceptance.
- Flat Character Arc: Character already believes in truth, truth is tested, and they win and keep the truth.
- Negative Character Arc: Character might lose positive traits, keep believing in a lie, and make decisions resulting in negative outcomes.

## Subtext in Screenplay
### Definition
- Subtext refers to the underlying themes, emotions, or meaning beneath the spoken dialogue.
- It’s what’s not being directly said but implied.
- The "hidden layer" in a conversation or scene, where the audience picks up on unspoken tension or desires through body language, silence, and context.

### Importance
- Creates depth in dialogue and characters.
- Makes the story feel more realistic.
- Adds tension and complexity, engaging the audience.

### Examples
- *The Godfather* (1972): Michael Corleone’s line “It’s not personal, Sonny. It’s strictly business” hides emotional betrayal.
- *Casablanca* (1942): Rick’s “Here’s looking at you, kid” suggests unspoken love.

### How to Use Subtext
- Character Goals and Conflicts: Characters want something but are afraid or unable to express it openly.
- Actions Over Words: Actions like avoiding eye contact or clenching fists communicate feelings.
- Context: Setting and situation add subtext.
- Contradiction: Characters say things that contradict their true feelings.

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Overuse: Too much subtext can confuse the audience.
- Too Little: Lack of subtext makes dialogue flat.

### Techniques to Enhance Subtext
- Conflict: Characters with conflicting goals.
- Silence: Pauses can communicate more than words.
- Ambiguity: Unclear intentions let the audience read between the lines.

### Key Takeaway
- Subtext is the unsaid—what’s felt, implied, or hinted at but never directly spoken.
- It turns simple dialogue into rich, multi-layered interactions that engage the audience and create deeper emotional impact.
- Actions often imply more than words.
