# Screenwriting Notes - Day 6

## Save the Cat
- A screenwriting concept where the protagonist does something early in the story to make them relatable or likable.
- Establishes an emotional connection with the audience.
- Example: In Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne decides not to kill Ra's al Ghul, shifting from vengeance to justice and hope.

## Enter Late, Exit Early (Dialogue & Scene Writing)
- Keep scenes tight and impactful.
- Enter Late: Start scenes at the latest possible moment — when tension or action begins.
- Exit Early: Leave the scene before everything is wrapped up — let the audience fill in the blanks or move forward with momentum.
- In dialogue, cut out greetings, small talk, or over-explaining. Stick to the essence.

## Linear vs Non-Linear Storylines
- Linear: Events unfold in chronological order. Clear cause and effect. Easier to follow.
- Non-Linear: Events are out of sequence (flashbacks, parallel timelines). Used to build mystery, reveal character depth, or play with audience expectations.

## Exposition
- Method of conveying backstory or world-building.
- Good exposition feels natural and is integrated into the story.
- Techniques: Dialogues, photographs/documents, flashbacks, environment/props.
- Purpose: Add depth, motivation, and emotional stakes.

## Writing Conflict and Character Depth
- Highlight the ordinary and make it extraordinary.
- Use the Unity of Opposites: Great conflict comes from characters with opposing needs, values, or goals locked in a situation where neither can back down.
- Make characters do something that contradicts their behavior to break stereotypes.
- Show the character’s problem and make them likable.
- Widen the perception of the character about themselves.
- Characters should be split between past (affecting present), present (immediate problem), and internal conflict.
