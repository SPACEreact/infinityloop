# Screenwriting Logline, Plot Development, and Exposure Basics

## 1. Logline Structure
- Who (protagonist) wants What (goal), but must How (method) while facing Conflict (challenge) caused by Antagonist (force or character).
- Example Template:
  A [flawed protagonist] must [achieve goal] by [taking action], but [conflict/antagonistic force] threatens to destroy their chances.

## 2. Synopsis Structure (for Selling)
- Short, around 5–8 lines max.
- Focus on protagonist, goal, stakes, antagonistic force, and a hook.
- Should feel like a movie trailer in words.
- Example Template:
  [Name] was always [starting condition]. But when [inciting event happens], they are forced to [main goal]. Standing in their way is [antagonist/conflict]. As [stakes escalate], [name] must [what they have to change about themselves] — or lose [what’s most important].

## 3. Plot Development Structure
- Story Step:
  - Hero Needs Something (External want and internal need)
  - Hero Can't Get It (Obstacles, antagonistic force, failure)
  - Hero Changes (Learns something, reinterprets world, changes their goal or self)

## Exposure Basics – Simplified Notes
- Exposure is how light or dark an image appears; it’s controlled by aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.

### Aperture
- Controls how much light enters the lens.
- Measured in f-stops (e.g., f/1.8, f/4).
- Lower f-stop = more light, blurrier background (shallow depth of field).
- Higher f-stop = less light, more in focus (deep depth of field).

### Shutter Speed
- Controls how long the sensor is exposed to light.
- Fast shutter = freezes motion.
- Slow shutter = shows motion blur.

### ISO
- Controls the sensor’s sensitivity to light.
- Higher ISO = brighter image, more noise.
- Lower ISO = cleaner image, less light sensitivity.

### Balancing Settings
- These three work together: changing one affects the others.
- Adjust them based on lighting conditions and creative intent.

### Light Meter
- Use the camera’s built-in light meter to help judge exposure.
- Aim for balanced readings unless you want intentional over/underexposure.

### Camera Modes
- Manual (M) – full control over all settings.
- Aperture Priority (A/Av) – you choose aperture, camera adjusts others.
- Shutter Priority (S/Tv) – you choose shutter speed, camera adjusts others.
- Program (P) – camera controls both but allows minor tweaks.

### Tips
- In low light, open the aperture, slow the shutter, or raise ISO.
- Practice in different conditions to build muscle memory and confidence.
