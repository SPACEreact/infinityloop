Day : 6 
Save the Cat is a screenwriting concept where the protagonist does something early in the story 
to make them relatable or likable, often referred to as "saving the cat." It establishes an 
emotional connection with the audience. 
In Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne's key "Save the Cat" moment is when he decides not to kill 
Ra's al Ghul and saves Gotham from destruction. This decision shifts him from a 
vengeance-driven character to a hero driven by justice and hope, aligning with the Save the Cat 
structure of a protagonist's moral transformation. 

Enter Late, Exit Early (Dialogue & Scene Writing) 
A storytelling principle used to keep scenes tight and impactful. 
Enter Late: Start scenes at the latest possible moment — right when the tension or action 
begins. 
Exit Early: Leave the scene before everything is wrapped up — let the audience fill in the blanks 
or move forward with momentum. 
In dialogue, this means cutting out greetings, small talk, or over-explaining. Stick to the essence 
of what’s being said or revealed. 

Linear vs Non-Linear Storylines 
Linear: Events unfold in chronological order. Clear cause and effect. Easier to follow. 
Non-Linear: Events are out of sequence (e.g., flashbacks, parallel timelines). Used to build 
mystery, reveal character depth, or play with audience expectations. 

Exposition 
The method of conveying backstory or world-building. 
Good exposition feels natural and is integrated into the story. 
Techniques include: 
Dialogues (character reveals info through conversation) 
Photographs/Documents (visual cues) 
Flashbacks (showing past events instead of telling) 
Environment/Props (set design that hints at history or conflict) 
Purpose: Add depth, motivation, and emotional stakes to the characters and world. 

Highlight the ordinary... Make it extraordinary. People should relate but it makes them to nah I 
am not even it that bad situation 
The real unity of opposites is one in which compromise is impossible." - to write conflict 
dialogue becomes powerful when characters have hidden agendas 
The Unity of Opposites is the theory that great conflict comes from characters with opposing 
needs, values, or goals, who are locked together in a situation where neither can back down or 
walk away. - to write conflict 
Make the character do somthing that contradict it's behaviour i.e old lady we imagine to be all go 
with the flow but what if they turn out to be mean. 
Break the stereotype of the character... Like whatever the character is.. 
What is the first thing character says...like sherlock's first dialogue is deduction.. that's first 
impression. 
Show what is the problem of character 
Make him likeable 
Widen the perception of about themselves.... 
Like walter white tell he is doing all for his family but he was doing all because his ego. 
Character should be spilt between 3 time... 
Past- he should have a past that affect his present 
Present - the immediate problem he faces ... Could be one personal conflict and one internal 
conflict.# Camera Movement Notes - Day 5

## 1. Slow Push-In
- What it is: The camera slowly moves closer to the subject, usually in a straight line (dolly or track in).
- Effect: Builds tension or draws the audience into a character’s internal world. Creates intimacy or anxiety.
- Used in: Emotional realizations, suspenseful moments.
- Example: In Interstellar, when Cooper watches the video messages from Earth — slow push-in adds emotional weight.

## 2. Creep-Out
- What it is: A slow backward camera movement, often away from a character.
- Effect: Makes the subject feel isolated, distant, or lost in their environment. Adds a haunting or reflective vibe.
- Mood: Loneliness, detachment, revelation.
- Think: The world keeps moving but the character is stuck.

## 3. The Moment
- What it is: Not a movement, but a concept — “The Moment” refers to the emotional or narrative peak in a scene. Camera moves are used to highlight it.
- Camera behavior: Often a slow push-in, or a steady lock on the actor’s face. Sometimes silence + stillness.
- Goal: Let the actor carry it. Don’t distract.

## 4. Distraction
- What it is: A purposeful use of movement, composition, or visual elements to mislead or redirect the audience’s focus.
- Camera trick: Pan or rack focus to something irrelevant before revealing the real subject.
- Usage: Builds suspense, surprise, or contrast.
- Example: A character talks calmly, but in the background — a small, crucial movement hints something’s wrong.

## 5. The Candidate
- Refers to: A famous use of paranoid, slow zooms or wide shots from The Candidate (1972) and other political thrillers.
- Camera style: Wide frame, subject small and distant, often zooming or pulling back.
- Effect: Powerlessness, surveillance vibe. The system is watching. You're just a pawn.
- Mood: Paranoia, bureaucracy, loss of control.
