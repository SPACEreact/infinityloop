# Story Idea Generation Notes

1. Dramatize the Normal
- Take everyday moments and ask: “What if this was life or death?”
- Example: A kid missing the school bus becomes a ticking clock thriller if he has to reach before 9 AM or loses his scholarship.
- Train yourself to look at mundane events as cinematic using hyperbole, stakes, and emotion.

2. Write Every Thought Related to the Idea
- Treat your mind like a chalkboard. Don’t filter. Just dump.
- Free-write 10–15 mins on a single idea.
- Write fragments, emotions, images, conflicts, overheard phrases.
- Sometimes the gold is not the first thought, but the third tangent.

3. “What If”
- Every story is a “what if” at heart.
- Examples:
  - What if a man forgot his memories every 24 hours but still tried to solve his brother’s murder? (Memento)
  - What if your enemy started living in your house and nobody else could see them?
- Try combos:
  - What if + personal fear
  - What if + social issue
  - What if + emotional paradox

4. Dreams
- Raw subconscious storytelling.
- Keep a dream journal.
- Convert dreams into 3-act structure outlines.
- Ask: What was the emotional core of the dream?

5. Forced Connections
- Take two unrelated things and build a story bridge.
- Example: A broken radio + a lost dog = a boy who thinks his dog is talking to him through static.
- Use tools like a random word generator + your mood.

6. Personal Experience
- Start from truth, then add fiction.
- First love, friendship fallouts, family secrets, childhood regrets.
- Ask: What was I feeling? What did I want to say but couldn’t?
- Layer a genre filter (thriller, drama, fantasy) over your life event.

7. Other People’s Experiences
- Talk to people. Listen deeply.
- Ask friends: What’s the most unforgettable thing that ever happened to you?
- Browse Reddit threads (r/OffMyChest, r/TrueOffMyChest, r/AskReddit)
- Read biographies, interviews, anonymous confessions.

8. Newspaper / Current Events
- Real-world conflict is ready-made drama.
- Find small, weird articles tucked away in the corner.
- Look for human interest + conflict + mystery.
- Example: “Man builds illegal library in abandoned train station.”

9. Visual Stimuli
- One image can contain a whole world.
- Scroll Pinterest, Instagram, AI-generated art.
- Pause films and ask: What happened before and after this frame?
- Save 5 images and write a short logline or scene from each.

10. Brainstorming
- Don’t stop at one idea. Go for quantity, then quality.
- Use mind maps: write a central word (e.g., "loss") → branch into memories, people, visuals, sounds.
- Try "top 10 story ideas around a theme."
- Collaborate — throw ideas around with friends. Add absurd constraints for fun.
