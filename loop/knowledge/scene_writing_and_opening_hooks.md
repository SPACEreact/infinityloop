# Scene Writing and Opening Hooks

## How to Write a Scene
- Write simply about what the character wants and how the scene changes the character.
- Rewrite the scene with a deeper connection on how the character reacted to the situation.
- Think about:
  - Who wants what from whom?
  - What happens if they don’t get it?
  - Why now?

## Opening Scene Types (Hooks)
- Flashback: Movies that start with a flashback.
- Flash Forward: Scene of the future, like someone telling the story.
- Mid-story: Starts from the middle of the movie or action.
- Newsreel: Start by showing news.
- The Setting: Showing the important place where the movie takes place.
- Crime: Start with a crime scene.
- Direct Addressing: Breaking the fourth wall by directly talking to the audience.
- Tragedy: Starting with the loss of something important.
- A Day in Life: Showing daily life.

## Establishing Shot
- Wide shots shown at the start of a scene.

## Other Hooks
- Tripod shot (static).
- Chasing sequence.

## 180° Rule
- An imaginary line between two characters.
- The camera should not cross this line to maintain spatial continuity.
- Ensures characters appear to be in the same place.
