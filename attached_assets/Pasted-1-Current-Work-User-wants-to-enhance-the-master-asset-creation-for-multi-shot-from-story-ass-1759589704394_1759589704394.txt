1. Current Work:
   - User wants to enhance the master asset creation for multi-shot from story assets.
   - Add similar feature for visual assets to batch style.
   - Add a button to create multi-shot assets with a separate modal for shot creation.
   - Multi-shot assets should be created as assets and usable in batch style generation.
   - Workspace.tsx is the main file managing assets, timelines, and UI.
   - No existing modal for shot creation found; ConfirmModal exists for delete confirmation.
   - handleGenerateOutput and handleCreateShots functions handle master asset and shot creation.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - React functional components with hooks.
   - Asset and timeline management.
   - Modal UI components.
   - Asset creation and updating project state.
   - AI suggestion integration.
   - MCP syncing.

3. Relevant Files and Code:
   - loop/components/Workspace.tsx: Main file with Workspace component and subcomponents.
     - handleGenerateOutput: creates master assets from story or image folders.
     - handleCreateShots: creates shots from master assets.
     - ConfirmModal: existing modal component.
     - AssetLibraryPanel, ControlPanel, SimpleTimelineView: UI components.
   - No other modal components found in codebase.

4. Problem Solving:
   - Need to add a new modal for multi-shot creation.
   - Add UI button to open modal.
   - Implement logic to create multi-shot assets from story assets in modal.
   - Implement similar for visual assets to batch style.
   - Ensure multi-shot assets can be passed to batch style generation.
   - Maintain existing functionality and UI consistency.

5. Pending Tasks and Next Steps:
   - Add MultiShotCreationModal component in Workspace.tsx.
   - Add button in timeline or control panel to open modal.
   - Implement modal UI to select story assets and create multi-shot asset.
   - Implement similar for visual assets to batch style.
   - Update handleGenerateOutput or add new handlers to support multi-shot generation.
   - Test creation and usage of multi-shot assets.
   - Ensure undo, toast notifications, and asset selection work correctly.
